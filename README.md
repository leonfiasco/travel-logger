# Travel-logger

I created this project as I've alway like the idea of the maps, that you can scratch away at locations you have been to, but I didnt want to have to pay for one so I thought maybe I could create one for myself using online tools and some research.


### Technologies

The app uses Node.JS, Express.js, MongoDB, React hooks, And mapbox which allows me to display a world map on the UI


### The app

The app itelf allows you to plot markers on locations you have travelled to and write a description about the place,add an image, rate it and allows you to add the date of when you visited.


## Future additions

In the future I'm going to add authentication so any user that logs on will be able to see their own respective locations and I'll like to add a photo collection that the user could upload multiple images from that location rather than just one.

more ideas will come to me in the future but for now thats what I would like to complete
